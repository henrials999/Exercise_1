The result doesn't amount to zero because the threads run with preemptive scheduling allowing for swapping threads in the middle of an operation on the shared variable, possibly cancelling calculation. This is called a race condition, since the outcome of the process is based on how the scheduler swaps threads, making it a race between the two threads.
